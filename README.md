## project 1:
__Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns__: In this project, you'll build and train your own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. Good luck!


## project 2:
__Dog-Breed Classifier__: In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.


## project 3:
__Generate TV Scripts__: Generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network.


## project 4: 
__Generate Faces__: Define two adversarial networks, a generator and discriminator, and train them until you can generate realistic faces.


## project 5: 
__Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model__: In this project, you will build and deploy a neural network which predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review. In addition, you will create a simple web app that uses your deployed model. __Note__: to avoid to be charged by AWS, the instance are removed from the server.
